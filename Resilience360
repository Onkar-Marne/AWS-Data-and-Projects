Project – Resilience360

Creating a multi-region high availability web application involves ensuring that your application is resilient to regional failures and can quickly failover to another region if needed. Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide for setting up such an application on AWS, including a sample web application and installation steps.

•	Use Case: Multi-Region High Availability Web Application

•	Objective: Implement a high-availability web application that spans multiple AWS regions to ensure disaster recovery and minimal downtime.

•	Architecture Overview

•	Components:

•	Web Application: Deployed across multiple AWS regions.

•	Database: Multi-region replication.

•	Storage: Global storage with replication.

•	DNS: Global routing and failover.

•	Monitoring and Alerts: Continuous monitoring and automatic alerts.

•	Backup: Regular backups and disaster recovery plan.

1. Sample Web Application Setup - 
•	We'll use a simple Node.js application as our sample web application. The web application will be containerized using Docker.

•	Create the Sample Web Application

•	Set Up the Node.js Project

•	Create Project Directory:

•	Bash Code

mkdir my-web-app
cd my-web-app
Initialize Node.js Project:

•	Bash Code
npm init -y
Install Express.js:

•	Bash Code
npm install express
Create index.js:

•	Javascript Code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  	res.send('Hello from the Multi-Region Web Application!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  	console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});

•	Create Dockerfile:

•	Dockerfile Code
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]

•	Build Docker Image:

•	Bash Code
docker build -t my-web-app .
Test Docker Image Locally:

•	Bash Code
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-web-app

2. Deploy the Application to AWS -
•	Set Up Multi-Region Infrastructure

•	Regions: For this example, we'll use us-east-1 (N. Virginia) and us-west-2 (Oregon).

•	Using Amazon ECS:

•	Create ECS Clusters in Each Region:

•	Navigate to ECS in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Cluster:

•	Choose “EC2 Linux + Networking” or “Fargate” for serverless containers.

•	Provide a name for the cluster and create it.

•	Create ECR Repositories:

•	Navigate to ECR.

•	Create Repository: Create a repository in each region (e.g., my-web-app).

•	Push Docker Image to ECR:

•	Authenticate Docker to ECR:

•	Bash Code
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
•	Tag and Push Image:

•	Bash Code
docker tag my-web-app:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-web-app:latest
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-web-app:latest
•	Create ECS Task Definitions:

•	Navigate to ECS Task Definitions.

•	Create New Task Definition:

•	Task Definition Name: my-web-app-task.

•	Container Definitions:
Image: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-web-app:latest.
Port Mappings: 3000:3000.
•	Create ECS Services:

•	Navigate to Services in ECS.

•	Create Service:

•	Cluster: Choose the cluster created in the respective region.

•	Service Name: my-web-app-service.

•	Task Definition: Choose the task definition created earlier.

•	Desired Tasks: Set the number of desired tasks (e.g., 2).

•	Set Up Load Balancing:

•	Create Application Load Balancer (ALB):

•	Navigate to EC2 > Load Balancers.

•	Create Load Balancer: Choose “Application Load Balancer”.

•	Listeners: Add a listener on port 80.

•	Target Groups: Create a target group pointing to the ECS service.

•	Set Up Database

•	Using Amazon RDS:

•	Create RDS Instances in Each Region:

•	Navigate to RDS in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Database:

•	Engine: Choose a database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

•	Instance Size: Choose the instance type.

•	Multi-AZ Deployment: Enable for high availability within the region.

•	Create Read Replicas: Set up read replicas in the secondary region for disaster recovery.

•	Using DynamoDB:

•	Create DynamoDB Global Table:

•	Navigate to DynamoDB in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Table:

•	Table Name: my-web-app-data.

•	Primary Key: Define as required.

•	Enable Global Tables to replicate data across regions.

•	Configure Storage

•	Using Amazon S3:

•	Create S3 Buckets:

•	Navigate to S3 in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Buckets: Create one bucket in each region.

•	Enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR):

•	Navigate to S3 Bucket Settings.

•	Enable Cross-Region Replication: Configure replication rules to replicate objects to the other region.
 





3. Configure DNS with Route 53 -
•	Create a Hosted Zone:

•	Navigate to Route 53.

•	Create Hosted Zone: Enter your domain details.

•	Set Up Routing Policies:

•	Create Record Sets:

•	Latency-Based Routing: Route traffic to the region with the lowest latency.

•	Failover Routing: Configure failover routing to redirect traffic to a secondary region if the primary region fails.

4. Implement Monitoring and Alerts -
•	Set Up CloudWatch

•	Create CloudWatch Dashboards:

•	Navigate to CloudWatch in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Dashboard: Add widgets to monitor application metrics.

•	Create Alarms:

•	Create Alarms for EC2 instance health, RDS metrics, and other relevant metrics.

•	Set Up CloudTrail

•	Enable CloudTrail:

•	Navigate to CloudTrail in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Trail: Ensure logging is enabled in all regions.
 



5. Implement Backup and Disaster Recovery -
•	Set Up Automated Backups

•	For RDS:

•	Navigate to RDS Backups.

•	Enable Automated Backups: Configure backup retention periods and manual snapshots.

•	For S3:

•	Enable Versioning:

•	Navigate to S3 Bucket Settings.

•	Enable Versioning: Retain previous versions of objects.

•	Create a Disaster Recovery Plan

•	Define RTO and RPO:

•	Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Define acceptable downtime.

•	Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Define acceptable data loss.

•	Implement Failover Procedures:

•	Route 53 Failover Routing: Configure failover routing to redirect traffic in case of region failure.

•	Document Manual Failover Procedures: Outline steps to manually switch to the backup region if needed.








Step 6: Test and Validate -
•	Conduct Failover Testing

•	Simulate Failures:

•	Simulate Regional Failures: Test the failover process by simulating failures in one region and validating traffic routing to the secondary region.

•	Validate Traffic Routing:

•	Check Route 53 Routing: Ensure Route 53 correctly routes traffic based on latency or failover configurations.

•	Perform Regular Drills

•	Schedule Drills:

•	Conduct Disaster Recovery Drills: Regularly test and validate your disaster recovery plan.

•	Update Documentation:

•	Keep Documentation Up-to-Date: Update any changes in infrastructure or procedures.

By following these steps, you’ll set up a robust multi-region high availability web application that can handle regional failures gracefully, ensuring minimal downtime and effective disaster recovery.

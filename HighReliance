Project – HighReliance

Creating a multi-region high availability web application for mission-critical applications involves ensuring that the application remains available and keeps on performing even in the face of regional failures. This involves distributing the application across multiple AWS regions, using redundant components, and implementing robust failover strategies. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide, including a sample web application and installation steps.

•	Use Case: Multi-Region High Availability Web Application for Mission-Critical Applications

•	Objective: Deploy a highly available and fault-tolerant web application across multiple AWS regions to ensure continuous operation and minimal downtime for mission-critical applications.

•	Architecture Overview

•	Components:

•	Web Application: Deployed across multiple AWS regions.

•	Database: Highly available and replicated across regions.

•	Storage: Global storage with replication.

•	DNS: Global routing with failover capabilities.

•	Load Balancing: Distribute traffic and handle failovers.

•	Monitoring and Alerts: Continuous monitoring and automatic alerts.

•	Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regular backups and disaster recovery plans.
 
1. Web Application Setup -
•	We'll use a simple Python Flask application as our web application. The application will be containerized using Docker.

•	Create the Web Application

•	Set Up Python Environment

•	Create Project Directory:

•	Bash Code
mkdir my-flask-app
cd my-flask-app
•	Create app.py:

•	Python Code
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    	return 'Hello from the Multi-Region High Availability Web Application!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    	app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

•	Create requirements.txt:

•	makefile
Flask==2.0.3
•	Containerize the Application

•	Create Dockerfile:

•	Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

•	Build Docker Image:

•	Bash Code
docker build -t my-flask-app .
•	Test Docker Image Locally:

•	Bash Code
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
 
2. Deploy the Application to AWS -
•	Set Up Multi-Region Infrastructure

•	Regions: For this example, we'll use us-east-1 (N. Virginia) and eu-west-1 (Ireland).

•	Using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):

•	Create ECS Clusters in Each Region:

•	Navigate to ECS in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Cluster:

•	Choose “Fargate” for serverless containers or “EC2 Linux + Networking” for EC2-based clusters.

•	Provide a name for the cluster and create it.

•	Create ECR Repositories:

•	Navigate to ECR.

•	Create Repository: Create a repository in each region (e.g., my-flask-app).

•	Push Docker Image to ECR:

•	Authenticate Docker to ECR:

•	Bash Code
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
•	Tag and Push Image:
•	Bash Code
docker tag my-flask-app:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-flask-app:latest
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-flask-app:latest
•	Create ECS Task Definitions:

•	Navigate to ECS Task Definitions.

•	Create New Task Definition:
Task Definition Name: my-flask-app-task.
•	Container Definitions:
Image: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-flask-app:latest.
Port Mappings: 5000:5000.
•	Create ECS Services:

•	Navigate to Services in ECS.

•	Create Service:

•	Cluster: Choose the cluster created in the respective region.
Service Name: my-flask-app-service.
•	Task Definition: Choose the task definition created earlier.

•	Desired Tasks: Set the number of desired tasks (e.g., 2).

•	Set Up Load Balancing:

•	Create Application Load Balancer (ALB):

•	Navigate to EC2 > Load Balancers.

•	Create Load Balancer: Choose “Application Load Balancer”.

•	Listeners: Add a listener on port 80.

•	Target Groups: Create a target group pointing to the ECS service.

•	Set Up Database

•	Using Amazon RDS:

•	Create RDS Instances in Each Region:

•	Navigate to RDS in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Database:

•	Engine: Choose a database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

•	Instance Size: Choose the instance type.

•	Multi-AZ Deployment: Enable for high availability within the region.

•	Create Read Replicas: Set up read replicas in other regions.

•	Using Amazon Aurora Global Database:

•	Create Aurora Global Database:

•	Navigate to RDS > Databases.

•	Create Database:

•	Engine: Choose Amazon Aurora.

•	Global Database: Enable global database to replicate data across multiple regions.

•	Configure Storage

•	Using Amazon S3:

•	Create S3 Buckets:

•	Navigate to S3 in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Buckets: Create one bucket in each region.

•	Enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR):

•	Navigate to S3 Bucket Settings.

•	Enable Cross-Region Replication: Configure replication rules to replicate objects to other regions.
 
3. Configure DNS with Route 53 -
•	Create a Hosted Zone:

•	Navigate to Route 53.

•	Create Hosted Zone: Enter your domain details.

•	Set Up Routing Policies:

•	Create Record Sets:

•	Latency-Based Routing: Route traffic to the region with the lowest latency.

•	Failover Routing: Configure failover routing to redirect traffic to a secondary region in case of regional failure.
 




4. Implement Monitoring and Alerts -
•	Set Up CloudWatch

•	Create CloudWatch Dashboards:

•	Navigate to CloudWatch in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Dashboard: Add widgets to monitor application metrics.

•	Create Alarms:

•	Create Alarms for ECS, RDS, and ALB metrics to get notified of any issues.

•	Set Up CloudTrail

•	Enable CloudTrail:

•	Navigate to CloudTrail in AWS Management Console.

•	Create Trail: Ensure logging is enabled in all regions to track API activity.
 
5. Implement Backup and Disaster Recovery -
•	Set Up Automated Backups

•	For RDS:

•	Navigate to RDS Backups.

•	Enable Automated Backups: Configure backup retention periods and manual snapshots.

•	For S3:

•	Enable Versioning:

•	Navigate to S3 Bucket Settings.

•	Enable Versioning: Retain previous versions of objects.

•	Create a Disaster Recovery Plan

•	Define RTO and RPO:

•	Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Define acceptable downtime.

•	Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Define acceptable data loss.

•	Implement Failover Procedures:

•	Route 53 Failover Routing: Configure failover routing to redirect traffic in case of regional failure.

•	Document Manual Failover Procedures: Outline steps to manually switch to the backup region if needed.
 
6. Test and Validate -
•	Conduct Failover Testing

•	Simulate Failures:

•	Simulate Regional Failures: Test the failover process by simulating failures in one region and validating traffic routing to the secondary region.

•	Validate Traffic Routing:

•	Check Route 53 Routing: Ensure Route 53 correctly routes traffic based on latency or failover configurations.

•	Perform Regular Drills

•	Schedule Drills:

•	Conduct Disaster Recovery Drills: Regularly test and validate your disaster recovery plan.

•	Update Documentation & Keep Documentation Up-to-Date: Update any changes in infrastructure or procedures.

By following these steps, you’ll have a multi-region high availability web application that provides continuous operation and low latency, even in the event of regional failures. This setup ensures that your mission-critical applications remain highly available and resilient.

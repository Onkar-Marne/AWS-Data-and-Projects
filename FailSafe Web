Project – FailSafe Web

Building a high-availability web application with disaster recovery involves setting up your application and infrastructure to handle failures and maintain functionality in case of outages. Below is a detailed step-by-step solution for achieving high availability and disaster recovery using AWS services:

1. Design Architecture for High Availability -
•	Components:

•	Frontend: Static website hosted on Amazon S3 with CloudFront.

•	Application Layer: AWS Elastic Beanstalk for web application deployment.

•	Database Layer: Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

•	Disaster Recovery: AWS Backup for backup and recovery; cross-region replication for S3.

2. Set Up Frontend with Amazon S3 and CloudFront -
•	Create and Configure S3 Bucket for Static Website Hosting

•	Navigate to Amazon S3:

•	Go to Amazon S3 Console.

•	Create a Bucket:

•	Click "Create bucket".

•	Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., my-high-availability-frontend).

•	Choose a region.

•	Click "Create bucket".

•	Upload Website Files:

•	Go to the "Objects" tab of your bucket.

•	Click "Upload".

•	Add your index.html, styles.css, script.js, and other assets.

•	Click "Upload".

•	Enable Static Website Hosting:

•	Go to the "Properties" tab of your bucket.

•	Scroll down to "Static website hosting" and click "Edit".

•	Enable "Static website hosting".

•	Set "Index document" to index.html.

•	Click "Save changes".

•	Set Up CloudFront

•	Navigate to CloudFront:

•	Go to CloudFront Console.

•	Create a Distribution:

•	Click "Create Distribution".

•	Choose "Web".

•	Configure the Distribution:

•	Origin Domain Name: Select your S3 bucket from the dropdown.

•	Origin Path: Leave blank.

•	Viewer Protocol Policy: Set to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS".

•	Default Root Object: Enter index.html.

•	Click "Create Distribution".

•	Update DNS Records (Optional):

•	Update your DNS settings to point to the CloudFront distribution using Route 53 or your domain registrar.

3. Set Up Application Layer with AWS Elastic Beanstalk -
•	Deploy a High Availability Elastic Beanstalk Environment

•	Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk:

•	Go to Elastic Beanstalk Console.

•	Create an Application:

•	Click "Create a new application".

•	Enter an application name (e.g., my-high-availability-app).

•	Click "Create Application".

•	Create an Environment:

•	Click "Create environment".

•	Choose "Web server environment".

•	Select "Python" (or your application’s platform).

•	Configure Environment for High Availability:

•	Environment Type: Choose "Load balanced" to ensure high availability across multiple instances.

•	Instance Type: Choose appropriate instance types.

•	Scaling: Configure Auto Scaling settings to handle traffic spikes.

•	Deploy Application Code:

•	Upload your application code in a ZIP file or use an S3 bucket.

•	Configure Load Balancer:

•	Go to the "Configuration" section of your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

•	Click "Edit" under "Load balancer".

•	Configure health checks and set up policies for load balancing.

•	Set Up Health Checks and Monitoring:

•	Use CloudWatch to monitor application health and set up alarms for instance health.

4. Set Up the Database Layer with Amazon RDS -
•	Deploy RDS with Multi-AZ Deployment

•	Navigate to RDS:

•	Go to Amazon RDS Console.

•	Create a Database Instance:

•	Click "Create database".

•	Choose "Standard Create".

•	Configure Database Settings:

•	Engine: Choose PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any other SQL engine.

•	DB Instance Class: Select an instance size (e.g., db.t3.micro for free tier).

•	Storage: Configure storage size (e.g., 20 GB).

•	Multi-AZ Deployment: Check "Create a standby instance" for high availability.

•	Database Name: Enter a name (e.g., mydatabase).

•	Master Username and Password: Set up credentials.

•	Configure Advanced Settings:

•	VPC: Choose the VPC where your Elastic Beanstalk application is located.

•	Public Accessibility: Set to "No" if you don't need public access.

•	Backup: Configure automated backups.

•	Launch the Database:

•	Click "Create database".

•	Wait for the database to become available.

5. Implement Disaster Recovery -
•	Configure AWS Backup for RDS

•	Navigate to AWS Backup:

•	Go to AWS Backup Console.

•	Create Backup Plan:

•	Click "Create backup plan".

•	Choose "Build a new plan".

•	Configure Backup Plan:

•	Define backup frequency (e.g., daily).

•	Set retention policies (e.g., keep backups for 30 days).

•	Assign Backup Plan:

•	Assign the plan to your RDS instance.

•	Set Up Cross-Region Replication for S3

•	Navigate to Amazon S3:

•	Go to Amazon S3 Console.

•	Enable Cross-Region Replication:

•	Go to the "Management" tab of your S3 bucket.

•	Click "Replication".

•	Click "Add rule".

•	Specify the destination region and bucket for replication.

•	Save the rule.

•	Set Up Elastic Beanstalk Application Versioning

•	Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk:

•	Go to Elastic Beanstalk Console.

•	Configure Versioning:

•	Ensure that you deploy new application versions to Elastic Beanstalk.

•	Use version labels and rollback capabilities to revert to previous versions if needed.

6. Testing and Validation -
•	Test Failover for RDS:

•	Simulate failover to verify that the standby RDS instance takes over.

•	Test Static Website and Application Layer:

•	Access your application through the CloudFront URL to verify it is functioning correctly.

•	Check the load balancing and scaling functionality.

•	Test Backup and Recovery:

•	Ensure that backups are created and can be restored from AWS Backup.

•	Verify that cross-region replication is working by checking replicated objects in the destination bucket.

•	Monitor and Optimize:

•	Use CloudWatch to monitor application performance and set up alarms for potential issues.

•	Optimize your infrastructure based on performance metrics.




7. Clean Up Resources - (Optional Settings)
•	Delete Elastic Beanstalk Environment:

•	Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console and terminate the environment.

•	Delete RDS Instance:

•	Go to the RDS Console and delete the database instance.

•	Delete S3 Bucket:

•	Go to the S3 Console and delete the bucket and its contents.

•	Delete CloudFront Distribution:

•	Go to the CloudFront Console and delete the distribution.

•	Delete Backup Plans:

•	Go to the AWS Backup Console and delete backup plans.

By following these steps, you will set up a high-availability web application with disaster recovery, ensuring that your application can handle failures gracefully and recover from disasters effectively.
